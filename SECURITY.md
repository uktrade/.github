## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit your report to us using [here](https://hackerone.com/2680e4cd-0436-42a5-bd2a-37fd86367276/embedded_submissions/new)
In your report please include details of:
- The website, IP or page where the vulnerability can be observed.
- A brief description of the type of vulnerability, for example; "XSS vulnerability".
- Steps to reproduce. These should be a benign, non-destructive, proof of concept. This helps to ensure that the report can be triaged quickly and accurately. It also reduces the likelihood of duplicate reports, or malicious exploitation of some vulnerabilities, such as sub-domain takeovers.
