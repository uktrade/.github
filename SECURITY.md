# SECURITY.md
**DBT GitHub Security Policy**

## Summary  
This policy explains how the public can responsibly [report vulnerabilities](reporting-a-vulnerability), and how DBT developers must protect sensitive information and follow DBT’s required security controls when working in GitHub.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report via our HackerOne [form](https://hackerone.com/2680e4cd-0436-42a5-bd2a-37fd86367276/embedded_submissions/new)

Please include:
- Where the issue can be observed (URL, IP address or page)  
- A brief description (e.g. “XSS vulnerability”)  
- Safe, non‑destructive reproduction steps  

**Disclosure guidelines**
- Do **not** share vulnerability details beyond DBT and the asset owner  
- HackerOne accounts are optional but allow updates  
- You must agree to HackerOne’s Terms, Privacy Policy, and Disclosure Guidelines  
- NCC Group triages reports within **five working days**  
- DBT Cyber assists with coordination, but the asset owner is responsible for remediation

## Handling Secrets

These requirements apply to DBT developers.

Information on secrets and their management can be found [here](https://dbis.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/DDaTDirectorate/Shared%20Documents/Work%20-%20GitHub%20Security/Github%20Security%20Framework/Guidelines%20and%20Policies/GitHub%20Security%20Standards%20v0.6.docx?d=w022dea8105074e36af5450797083c297&csf=1&web=1&e=SR5out).

Instructions on what to do in the event of a leak can be found [here](https://dbis.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/DDaTDirectorate/Shared%20Documents/Work%20-%20GitHub%20Security/Github%20Security%20Framework/Incident%20Response/GitHub%20Repository%20Incident%20Playbook.docx?d=w9ba04ffa4a7c4ff38faaaf12ff030c94&csf=1&web=1&e=yZF5dO).

**In summary, developers must:**
- Never commit secrets or sensitive data to GitHub  
- Use secure storage for managing secrets
- Ensure no secrets appear in PRs, logs, config files, or history
- Follow incident‑response steps immediately if a leak occurs

## Security Controls

DBT uses several processes to strengthen the security posture of our GitHub repositories.

Use this checklist to ensure your repository implements these processes:

- [ ] **Create or update `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`**  
      See: [SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md](#security_checklistmd)

- [ ] **Review the CI/CD overview**  
      See: [CI/CD Overview](#cicd-overview)

- [ ] **Set up the pre‑commit hook framework**  
      See: [Pre‑Commit Hooks](#precommit-hooks)

- [ ] **Set up custom GitHub properties**  
      See: [Custom GitHub Properties](#custom-github-properties)

- [ ] **Apply the DBT GitHub security policy**  
      See: [GitHub Security Policy](#github-security-policy)

- [ ] **Ensure a `CODEOWNERS` file exists**  
      See: [CODEOWNERS](#codeowners)

- [ ] **Review GitHub Safety Tips (internal)**  
      See: [GitHub Safety Tips](#github-safety-tips)

- [ ] **Add at least one Repository Steward**  
      See: [Repository Access & Governance](#repository-access--governance)

- [ ] **Create an admin team**  
      See: [Repository Access & Governance](#repository-access--governance)

- [ ] **Limit admin rights to the strict minimum**  
      See: [Repository Access & Governance](#repository-access--governance)

- [ ] **Review the Pull Request template**  
      See: [Pull Request Template](#pull-request-template)

- [ ] **Review this SECURITY.md**  
      See: [SECURITY.md](#securitymd)

- [ ] **Review branch protection rules**  
      See: [Branch Protection Rules](#branch-protection-rules)

- [ ] **Confirm push protection is enabled**  
      See: [Push Protection](#push-protection)  

---

### SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md

Create `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md` in the root of your repository if not present. Copy the checklist and update it as checks are completed.

---

### CI/CD Overview

Review the GitHub CI/CD Overview which summarises the controls DBT has in place to strengthen the security posture of our GitHub repositories.

![CI/CD overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uktrade/.github/refs/heads/main/assets/CI-CD%20pipeline.svg)

---

### Pre‑Commit Hooks

DBT requires all contributors to use the organisation‑approved pre‑commit hooks before committing. A GitHub Action blocks PRs where the hook has not run.

For more information and setup guidance please refer [here](https://github.com/uktrade/github-standards).

---

### Custom GitHub Properties

DBT uses custom github properties to enforce branch protection rules and run organisation level github actions.

Manage custom properties:
`https://github.com/uktrade/REPO_NAME/settings/access`

**Mandatory**
- `reusable_workflow_opt_in` - `true`  
- `scs_portfolio` - The portfolio associated with your CSC. If your portfolio is missing, this can be added by raising an SRE ticket.

**Optional**
- `is_docker` — for repos that build Docker images  
- `language` — all languages used by this repository should be selected, and github workflows will run with dedicated checks on that language.  

---

### GitHub Security Policy

DBT has introduced a new organisation-wide GitHub security policy that applies the required security checks to every repository. New repositories get this policy by default, but existing ones must have it enabled before they can be made public. Over time, this policy will fully replace the old one across the uktrade account.

**You must be an organisation administrator to apply this policy**

To add the new security policy, follow these instructions:

1. As an organisation administrator, navigate to the [security config page](https://github.com/organizations/uktrade/settings/security_products).
1. Scroll down to the **Apply configurations** sections, and enter the name of the repository to be made public in the filter input field
1. Use the checkbox next to the results list to select all repositories being made public, then use the **Apply configuration** button to select the **Default DBT security** configuration
1. A confirmation modal will appear displaying a summary of the action being made. Click the apply button
1. In the repository that has had the new policy applied, navigate to the **Advanced Security** page in the repository settings. At the top of the page there should be a banner message **Modifications to some settings have been blocked by organization administrators.**

---

### CodeQL for Fork‑Based PRs (Optional)

The default DBT GitHub Security policy does not currently support scanning PRs raised from a fork of a repository.
If PRs from forks must be supported, switch to **Advanced** CodeQL to generate a `codeql.yml` workflow.  
[1](https://dbis.sharepoint.com/sites/DDaTDirectorate/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B022DEA81-0507-4E36-AF54-50797083C297%7D&file=GitHub%20Security%20Standards.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

---

### CODEOWNERS

Repositories must include a `CODEOWNERS` file:
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

---

### GitHub Safety Tips

Internal contributors should review the [GitHub Safety Tips](https://uktrade.atlassian.net/wiki/x/n4AEKQE) to understand how to protect themselves when coding in the open.

---

### Repository Access & Governance

TBC

---

### Pull Request Template

If your repository does not already contain a pull_request_template.md file, you will inherit the DBT template by default. If you are already using your own template, you should add this section to remind reviewers they should be ensuring no secret values are visible:

### Reviewer Checklist

- [ ] I have reviewed the PR and ensured no secret or sensitive data is present

---

### Branch Protection Rules

An organisation ruleset has been created to apply a minimum set of branch protection rules:

- A PR is required for merges into the default branch (usually main)
- At least 1 approver is required before a PR can be merged
- Any conversations on the PR must be marked as resolved

Organisation admins and repository admins have been added to the bypass list for this branch protection ruleset.

Repository admins might decide to add additional rules to their own repositories. It is not possible for repository admins to add their own rules that reduce this level of protection. As an example, a repository admin could add a ruleset that drops the required number of approvers to 0 but that would have no effect as the organisation ruleset would take precedence. They could add a ruleset that sets the number of approvers to 3, and as this is not reducing the organisation ruleset protection this would take precedence.

---

## Push Protection

Push protection is required for all repositories using the default DBT GitHub security policy.  
DBT also defines [custom secret‑scanning patterns](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/secret-security/about-push-protection)
Please raise a ticket with SRE if you need additional patterns.
